<p>RedTri 2.0 has 100 levels.</p>
<p>There's a *genuinely* phat reward if you manage to beat it.</p>
<p>(you'll find references to the prize in future levels)</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>*IMPORTANT*</p>
<p>Keep a text file of every level's answer and url.</p>
<p>Potentially how you reached the solution too.</p>
<p>You'll NEED this to solve certain levels.</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>If a level has a google bar, it means you have to search online for the answer or additional information.</p>
<p>If there is no google bar, everything you need is hidden somewhere in the level.</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>Some levels will require you to use certain software.</p>
<p>But they're all free. Shit like paint.net, gimp, or audacity.</p>
<p>Dw linh, they all have malware.</p>
